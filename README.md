# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
This analysis provides information on ride-sharing data by city type along with displaying the total weekly fares for each city. A main purpose of this analysis is to display how diferences regarding city types can be crucial in decision making topics at PyBer. In this anlysis, I was able to understand and display the differences in fare by city type and how they correltae and differ for each city type. Each city type demonstrated how much they differ as the population and the need for transportation all incoorporate to the success of PyBer. 

## Results
Upon completing the analysis of each city, one can concur that the Rural city type is the least successful as it has the lowest amonut of fares. The most successful city type is an Urban city, and a Suburban city type is among the average in regards to the weekly fare amount. The PyBer Fare chart presents how much the city types differ below and how there are multiple peaks and lows that correlate for all cities as well.

## Summary
Due to results shown above, some recommendations that can be made  for the CEO of PyBer include, creating specified advertising to city areas that seem to be using PyBer the least such as Rural areas, in order to attempt to increase revenue. Due to the low dips in fare revenue during the beginning of the year, the CEO should also try to incorporate promotions to both drivers and riders of PyBer. Lastly, to help address disparities of the cities, drivers should be able to venture from different types of cities in order to help alleviate and negative effects to their income if they are soley in one city type.
